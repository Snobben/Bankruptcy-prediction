# Bankruptcy-prediction
In this repo, there lies a rstudio file of code from a school project me and a classmate worked on fall 2020 in a Data Science course,
where we attempted to predict bankruptices of Norwegian companies using variables from the Altman Z-score model or variables from the SEBRA model used by the Norwegian central bank to predict bankruptices. 
The goal of this project is to try to implement a similar but better, more thorough piece of work written in Python so that i get to learn doing data science in python,
which is the programming language i've used the most. 
I have gotten access to a more messy, larger and unprepared version of the dataset we got to work with in school,
so it is really going to be a challenge with data wrangling; my data science course was mostly about the statistics and models used when having access to data in the right format. I will also probably make a paper/summary of my findings from the Python implementation, but i have not uploaded the paper we wrote on the r project because it lies on my schoolmates computer, plus it is not that polished and i would rather get started working in python instead of finishing up an old paper which is structured kind off weirdly because of how we had to answer step-by-step questions.
